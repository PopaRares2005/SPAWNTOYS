        &#x2022;We know that when you receive your collectibles, everything comes down to that perfect unboxing moment. But sometimes, things don’t go as planned. If that happens, don’t worry — we’re here to help!
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x2022;Our goal at Sideshow is to ensure that our collectors are 100% satisfied with every purchase. As such, all of our direct customers are covered by a 30-Day Return & Exchange window. This warranty starts at that highly anticipated moment when your item arrives on your doorstep. Just contact us within 30 days of delivery, and one of our expert Product Support Representatives can assist you in finding a solution that’s right for your collection.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x2022;Due to the limited nature of our collectibles, we encourage everyone to open and inspect their purchase immediately upon delivery, so that you can take advantage of the warranty if needed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x2022;If your item arrives damaged, send in some photos of the damage and we'll pay for the return shipping.

Once we receive the item back, you'll get the refund or replacement that you requested. If you just decide that you simply don't want the item anymore, then the cost of the return label will be deducted from your refund.

Please know that if your item is outside of the 30-day window, we won't be able to provide a return, refund, or credit.

        My item is damaged or defective. How can you help?

      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="text">
        &#x2022; Sideshow’s collectibles are hand-crafted and painted, which can create small differences between each piece, thus making them truly unique and totally awesome. While these natural variations are not considered flaws, items that arrive with production defects or those that have been damaged in transit can be exchanged (based on stock availability) or returned for a full refund. In these cases, Sideshow will assist you in returning the item at our expense.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&#x2022;You may submit Product Support-related requests by logging into your Sideshow online account and accessing the Orders page. From there, scroll to the item in question and select 'Get help for this item.’ Then just fill out the Product Support form.

Be sure to provide the requested details and some clear photos when applicable. If a return label is being issued for your item, this is also where you would go to access the QR code/printable label.

For our U.S. collectors, we will provide a pre-paid QR code label to present to the carrier, as well as a standard printable PDF label. For our international collectors, we will have other return options available based on your location, such as providing a pre-paid DHL label and all necessary return documentation.

If you are shipping to/from an APO or FPO address, we will follow up on your inquiry with specific return instructions.

We may also be able to make your piece whole again by providing individual parts. However, please know that this is dependent upon stock availability and the interchangeability of each component of the collectible.

        &#x2022;Once your item is received, refunds are typically processed within 5-7 business days. However, please note that it can take up to 14 business days for the funds to post to the original payment method(s), depending on your financial institution.

        &#x2022; The item must be returned in the same condition it was sent to you. There is no need to attempt a repair, as we like to inspect any damaged collectibles upon their return (for our own R&D purposes).
    Send back all figures, accessories, bases, original packaging, and outer shipping cartons. This includes the brown shipping box. If the original brown shipper cannot be used for any reason, please be sure to use a comparable box of an appropriate size with the return packaged securely within. Returning incomplete products may delay exchanges or refunds, and even prevent us from being able to assist you with future inquiries.
    Items that arrive with excessive damage due to improper repacking may be subject to additional fees, which is typically 10% of the product price. Please be sure to use the original packaging and let us know if you need tips on how to properly pack your item so you don’t incur this fee!
